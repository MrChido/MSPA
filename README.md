# melzers_symptom_tracker

This is a Symptom tracker for my Wife, she conscripted her phone to generate a napp to help her track how she feels,
what time she got up, went to bed, foods medications, activites and symptoms

Her phone only gave her a 'seed' for the program and she is alowing me to write it up and make a reality


project timeline


this project got started early may 2025, i finaly got the CLI/Git to upload to github so some of the timeline got lost

6/8/2025
Wife sugetsted the boolean toggle for Pain is unnecisary since therews a value slider, so I took that out.
I also relegated the Entry Screen to its own dart file. It ensures the code is shapely, readable, and easily searchable for updates
also got git to finaly upload everything, so that others can fiddle with the code. or try the app itself before it goes life on 
google play at the end of summer.
